# radix-vulnerability-scanner-api

The for Radix Vulnerability Scanner API provides access to vulnerability scan results for applications hosted in Radix.
See [Radix Vulnerability Scanner](https://github.com/equinor/radix-vulnerability-scanner?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for details on installation and DB Credentials (we use managed identities).

## Developing

You need Go installed. Make sure `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` are properly set up.

Also needed:

- [`go-swagger`](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) (on a Mac, you can install it with Homebrew: `brew install go-swagger`)
- [`statik`](https://github.com/rakyll/statik) (install with `go get github.com/rakyll/statik`)
- [`gomock`](https://github.com/golang/mock) (GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@v1.4.4)

Clone the repo into your `GOPATH` and run `go mod download`.

### Generating mocks

We use gomock to generate mocks used in unit test.
You need to regenerate mocks if you make changes to any of the interface types used by the application

`make mocks`

### Running locally

Run once after cloning of the GitHub repository:

1. `go mod download`
1. `make swagger`
1. `make generate-radix-api-client`

The following env var is needed. Useful default values in brackets.

- `SQL_SERVER` - SQL server name
- `SQL_DATABASE` - SQL database name
- `RADIX_ENVIRONMENT` - Radix environment (ex. `qa`)
- `RADIX_CLUSTERNAME` - Radix cluster name (ex. `weekly-33`)
- `RADIX_DNS_ZONE` - Radix DNS zone (ex. `dev.radix.equinor.com`)
- `USE_LOCAL_RADIX_API`
  - `false`, `0` or not set` - connecting to in-cluster `radix-api`
  - `true` or `1` - connecting to `radix-api`, running on `http://localhost:3002`
- `USE_PROFILER`
  - `false`, `0` or `not set` - do not use profiler
  - `true` or `1` - use [pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/) profiler, running on `http://localhost:7070/debug/pprof`. Use web-UI to profile, when started service:

    ```sh
      go tool pprof -http=:6070 http://localhost:7070/debug/pprof/heap
    ```

## Deployment

Radix Vulnerability Scanner API follows the [standard procedure](https://github.com/equinor/radix-private/blob/master/docs/how-we-work/development-practices.md#standard-radix-applications) defined in _how we work_.

Radix Vulnerability Scanner API is installed as a Radix application in [script](https://github.com/equinor/radix-platform/blob/master/scripts/install_base_components.sh) when setting up a cluster.
